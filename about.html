            <h3>
              The Blackeye Collective serves as a platform for me to share my
              love of the craft beer movement and to hopefully engage more with
              likeminded members of the beer appreciation community.
            </h3>
            <p>
              A little bit about me. I have spent the last seven years employeed
              in the aviation industry working as a pilot in skydiving, charter
              flights and air ambulance across Australia, New Zealand and the
              Pacific Islands. 
              <p>     Before aviation I worked in artisan cafes, bars
                and coffee roasteries. Among other ventures, I roasted coffee in
                Wellington, New Zealand and opened a cafe with a view to setting
                new standards of quality for coffee in the blossoming coffee scene
                in Brighton, England. While I developed a love for quality wine
                working with sommeliers in the Supper Club in Melbourne,
                Australia, my true passion has always been craft beer.</p>
          After relocating to the Netherlands I found that I was spending all my
              free time exploring the Dutch brewing scene. The ability to bike
              around freed me up to explore local breweries and grow my interest
              in slow food (traditional, whole, locally-sourced foods) and beer.
              I have created this website to share my opinions on all things
              beer.
              </p>
            <p>
              Get in touch and let me know if about your beer experiences and I
              will publish them here. With the Blackeye Beer Collective, I hope
              to contribute to an already thriving beer community, provide some
              helpful hints for follow beer lovers looking to check out
              Amsterdam and most importantly drink lots of good beer.

            I like building things, going fast and eating and drinking with
            friends. If you enjoy craft beers as much as I do, join me in my
            exploration of everything beer and borrel related to discover and
            share delicious new flavours and support small and local businesses.
