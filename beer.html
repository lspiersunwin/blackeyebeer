              IPA was brewed extra heavily and extra hopped so that it could be drunk in the colonies (where I hail from). The craft beer revolution has led to a massive growth in appreciation for hoppy flavours, from the fruit juice flavours in New England IPAs, to the more traditional kicking bitterness in classic IPAs. Having spent my youth consuming cheap lagers and pilsners in grotty dive bars, for me, a quality IPA, was the gateway to craft beer. As a patriotic Dutch import myself, I can recommend the north sea IPA from Jopen, which happens to be a truly homegrown delight.
              <p>
              Last year my wife and I made the pilgrimage to the Jopen brewery on our bikes. The journey took us all the way from our appartment in Amsterdam west to Haarlem, something I suggest you try if your butt cheeks can handle it. The Jopen Brewery is located within a beautiful cathedral truly matching the qauality beer inside. If you want to understand how beer can change a whole community, look no further than the Jopen brewery. At the time it was founded, Jopen van Haarlem was commissioned to give the city of Haarlem in the Netherlands a whole new look for the cityâ€™s 750th anniversary. How? By recreating traditional old Haarlem beer recipes from way back in 1407!
            </p>
              
              Jopen Mooi Nel IPA is named after the water between Haarlem and Spaarndam and outside the Netherlands is called North Sea IPA. It is highly drinkable and has the crisp hoppy flavours you can expect from a quality (and fresh) IPA. A very pleasant aroma of malts mixed with citris fruits. Pours a clear pale orange. In the mouth there is a lovely hoppy bitterness with underlying malt character. Some honey sweetness plus hints of citrus. The hops rain supreme in the finish. Very nice indeed and definitely the "bike bum" pain the next day.

                    The current IPA trend tends to include the rounder fruity styles. While I have certainly enjoyed a fair few of these IPAs over summer, I have to admit that I miss the dry hoppyness of a more classical IPA. If you feel the same, the Bird of Prey IPA from Uiltje (little owl) is the beer for you. Best of all, Uiltjes are readily available from your local Albert Heijn for a reasonable price. 
               </p>
               <p>
                The brewery prides themselves on creating the best hoppy beer. Their primary objective, as stated proudly on the website is "to to brew f*cking great beer". They are absolutely on the right track in their noble mission.
               </p>

                  <p>The aroma is the crisp and standard grapefruit with dry grassy notes in the max-width. You can really understand why it is called bird of prey, as you are knocked flat by the strong wave of hoppy goodness. Death from above.</p>

                  <p>I have a special place in my heart for this beer (and this brewery). One of the things that initially drew me into the world of slow food and craft beer was the surrounding culture and art scene. My initial exposure to new styles of beer back in New Zealand were the can designs featured on the cans of Wellington-based Garage Project. Garage project started in (you can imagine) an abandoned fuel station. My wife's best friend actually designed the label for one of their special edition cans and you can even buy books on their labels. Throughout my travels I am on the hunt for new beers, and when faced with a choice between unknown beers I am not afraid to say I tend to base my decision on the label design.
              
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This was certainly the case when I first moved to Amsterdam. Before I had the oppotunity to visit any local beer haunts like the Wilderman or Arendsnest I ventured to my local supermarket to buy a bottle of the aestetically pleasing Oedipus Mannenliefde (man love). I was not let down.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I gather that Mannenliefde was considered to be a breakthrough beer for its brewery Oedipus, and its easy to see why. The saison variety of beer comes from the french "season". This variety of pale ale is highly carbonated, fruity, spicy, and often bottle conditioned as it is brewed in the cooler, less active months in farmhouses in Wallonia, the French-speaking region of Belgium, and stored in the summer months. It was historically brewed with low alcohol levels, but modern productions of the style have moderate to high levels of alcohol. It is generally classified as a farmhouse ale. The characteristics of this beer make it a brilliant candidate for the spicy asian influenced flavours of lemongrass and chilli.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Pours a pale yellow color with thick white head. Aroma of lemongrass, peppers, hops. These aromas are however not overly present in the taste. In the mouth there is a satisfying combination of malt, pepper and coconuts, with just a hint of the aforementioned lemongrass and spice. Nice one Oedipus.
