              COVID-19 has impacted almost every part of our lives. The way we live, travel and work have changed immensely and are likely to be altered for a while to come. One area that has been impacted is corporate events suitable to social distancing. Enter virtual beer tasting!
            </p>
            <p>
              After some dire months at home, many offices are looking to bolster staff morale and team spirit by hosting a corporate event. However, the options for fun, safe, socially distanced events are limited. As the hospitality industry has suffered more than most from the pandemic, we have noticed some breweries capitalizing on the opportunity by offering online beer tastings. Google tells me there are over 60 million related search results, which doesn't surprise me. Online beer tasting experiences include home-delivery of a special curated selection of beers, hosted by a beer connoisseur all through our familiar virtual conference technology. After having taken part of a few of these events, I have compiled a few do's and dont's for breweries looking to take their offering online.
            </p>
<br>
            <h1>Do</h1>

            <ol>
              <li>The experience starts as soon as your guests receive the package, so take time to curate the content. Include some beer notes and information about the event. Breweries should also offer the ability for companies to include some tailored content about the event. 
              </li>
              <li>  No one likes warm beer, so allow for plenty of time for participants to refrigerate the beer in advance. Don't leave too much time in between though, as some beers might mysteriously dissapear...
              </li>
              <li>People already spend a lot of time sitting behind their computers during work hours. Suggest participants choose a different location to break away from the humdrum of work. One of my colleagues got really creative and participated on his boat.
              </li>
              <li>Move around. People love breweries and all the elements that go into beer brewing. Engage your audience by taking them closer into the brewing process. 
              </li>
              <li>Ask for feedback and improve your service based on the complaints and compliments you receive. Even a complaint is a gift!
              </li>
            </ol><br>

<h1>Don't </h1>

<ol><li>Creating an interactive experience via virtual conferencing technology takes time. Don't underestimate the effort required to design a truly interactive session. To avoid a dull experience, think about using breakout rooms for large groups or including an online quiz to bolster interactivity and engagement.
</li>
<li>Don't forget the snacks to match the offering! Well matched food creates an even better experience and can really bring out the right flavours in your beers. 
</li>
<li>Don't just rely on your standard VC set-up. If your sound or video aren't crystal clear, your guests will have a frustrating experience. 
</li>
<li>Don't forget to encourage customer loyalty. You now have access to potential long term customers. Use the opportunity to encourage customers to come to your brewery or buy your beer by offering discounts after the event. 
</li></ol>

                    As a music lover I was saddened to hear of the closure of the historic base for Amsterdams red light readio in the heart of our red light district. I reccomend that you listen to this old episode featuring Lieneke Wielhouwer.
                  </p>
                  <p>                    Nowadays she co-runs Red Light Radio, the legendary Amsterdam music platform who are searching for a new direction after leaving their spiritual home.Tune in to hear Lien discuss the ins and outs of music and programming.</p>

                    Since returning to Amsterdam in August 2020, I was able to secure employment at the flagship Deus Ex Machina Cafe and Bar "The Wat of Why".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      My whole life I have been interested in machines. Prior to returning to Amsterdam I was employed in the Aviation industry as a pilot since 2012. My background trying to rebuild old motorcycles, in tandem with a love for the artwork produced by Deus founder Dare Jennings meant I could not resist the opportunity to go inside and have a look when I biked past its 88 Herengracht location. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Deus is an underappreciated Gem in the Amsterdam food and beverage scene. The interior is incredible with an open ceiling and a wide array of classic motorcycles on loan from Yamaha on display. there is even a custom Deus boat sitting in the hallway!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The food is lovingly prepared and comforting. It is also importantly very reasonably priced. They have a good array of local beers, a few IPA from Brothers in Law brewery, a lovely Gin Weizen from Gebrouwen door Vrouwen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Keep an eye out in out post covid world for musical and art events as the crew at Deus are determined to tough out these rough times and have big plans for the future.
